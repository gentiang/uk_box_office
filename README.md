# Analysis of UK Box Office Revenue from its Top 15 Movies in 2022

In this project, I analyze box office revenue from UK cinemas in the year 2022 focusing on only the top 15 movies for each weekend. The data for the box office is acquired from BFI UK as well as IMDB to figure out the revenue breakdown for several kinds of box office characteristics. The data is cleaned in R and visualized in Tableau via an interactive dashboard.
